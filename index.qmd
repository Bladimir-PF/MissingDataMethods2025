title: "Missing Data Methods (Spring 2025; University of Iowa: PSQF 7375)"
---

### Course Objectives

This course section explores missing data methods in applied statistics, data science, and psychometrics; emphasizing techniques such as multiple imputation, Bayesian methods, and maximum likelihood to handle and analyze incomplete data sets effectively.

## Course Readings

The course will follow the chapters of Applied Missing Data Analysis (2nd Edition) by Craig Enders. The University of Iowa Library has electronic access to the book at <https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu/lib/uiowa/detail.action?docID=7027149>. Additional readings will be posted our course ICON site.
