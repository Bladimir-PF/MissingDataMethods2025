Instead, we will use freely available commercial software for communication and dissemination of course materials. Course lecture slides, lecture examples, video files, assignments, and information are available on the website. Additionally, all course materials will be available using the course Git repository.\nAll lectures will be archived on YouTube (my YouTube channel is https://jonathantemplin.com/YouTube).\n\nStatistical Computing\nThe course will use the R statistical package with the R Studio development suite along with a set of R packages (both Bayesian and Non-Bayesian). Additionally, we will use the JAGS and Stan open-source Bayesian estimation programs. R and R Studio work with JAGS and Stan by using a series of downloadable packages which will be used throughout the course.\nR, R Studio, and stan are available for free from the following websites: R: https://www.r-project.org/ R Studio: https://www.rstudio.com/ Stan: https://mc-stan.org/ JAGS: https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io\nThe University of Iowa enables access for many of these programs through their research computing resources: R Studio Notebooks: https://notebooks.hpc.uiowa.edu/ High Performance Computing: https://hpc.uiowa.edu/\nAlthough this software is available at the University of Iowa, I ask that you install all versions on your local computer as campus resources can be difficult to use for many analyses."
