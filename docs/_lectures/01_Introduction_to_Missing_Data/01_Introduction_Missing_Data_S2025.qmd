<!-- Planned missing data: Different forms in psychometrics -->

## Learning Objectives

1.  Understand the challenges and implications of missing data in research
2.  Classify missing data by patterns and mechanisms using Rubin’s framework
3.  Recognize the limitations of outdated missing data methods
4.  Explore the design and application of planned missing data methods

# Importance of Missing Data

## Why Missing Data Matters

-   Missing data is pervasive across disciplines (e.g., education, psychology, medicine, political science)
-   One big example: Polling errors in elections in 2016/2020 seemed to be affected by missing data (MNAR) - Remedies have been subjective at best
-   Mishandling missing data can:
    -   Bias results --\> Inaccurate conclusions
    -   Reduce statistical power

### Modern Methods

-   **Maximum Likelihood (ML):** Estimates parameters directly from observed data likelihood
-   **Bayesian Estimation:** Combines prior beliefs with data likelihood
-   **Multiple Imputation (MI):** Reflects uncertainty by filling in missing data with plausible values

Additional note: Methods here typically require full-information analyses (i.e., likelihoods based on the data directly)

## Missing Data Patterns vs. Mechanisms

-   A missing data pattern refers to the configuration of observed and missing values in a data set
    -   What you observe in data
-   A missing data mechanism refers to processes that describe different ways in which the probability of missing values relates to the data
    -   Typically untestable
    -   What is assumed about data
-   Patterns describe where the holes are in the data, whereas mech- anisms describe why the values are missing

## Univariate Pattern

-   Missing values restricted to one variable
-   Example: Missing outcomes for some participants

## Monotone Pattern

-   Missing data accumulates predictably
-   Example: Dropout in longitudinal studies
-   Can be treated without complicated iterative estimation algorithms

## General Pattern

-   Missing data scattered randomly across the dataset
-   The three contemporary methods (maximum likelihood, Bayesian estimation, and multiple imputation) work well with this configuration
-   Generally no reason to choose an analytic method based on the missing data pattern alone

## Planned Missingness

-   Variables are intentionally missing for a large proportion of respondents
-   Can reduce respondent burden and research costs
-   Often with minimal impact on statistical power

## Latent Variable Pattern

-   Latent variables are essentially missing data
    -   Presents challenges in secondary analyses
-   Example: Iowa wishes to understand how well an incoming student's ACT score predicts first year GPA
    -   ACT Score: An estimate--not an observation
        -   Can think of scores as single imputation

## Underidentified Pattern

-   Insufficient overlap of data for estimation
-   Example: Sparse cell counts for categorical variables

# Missing Data Mechanisms

## Hypothetical Data Partitioning: Observed Data

::: columns
::: column
-   Before getting to the types of missing data mechanisms, we must first define some notation
-   Our observed data matrix will be defined as $\mathbf{Y}_{(\text{obs})}$
-   Here, $\mathbf{Y}_{(\text{obs})} = \left[Y_1, Y_2, Y_3 \right]$
:::

::: column
![](img/Yobs.png){fig-align="center" width="200"}
:::
:::

## Hypothetical Data Partitioning: Complete Data

::: columns
::: column
-   Imagine if you could somehow see what the values of the missing data were -- the complete data
-   Our hypothetical data matrix will be defined as $\mathbf{Y}_{(\text{com})}$ (sometimes denoted $\mathbf{Y}_{(1)}$)
-   Note: This is not possible through any method and is only a hypothetical example to help define missing data mechanisms
:::

::: column
![](img/lecture01/Ycom.png){fig-align="center" width="200"}
:::
:::

## Hypothetical Data Partitioning: Missing Data

::: columns
::: column
-   Now, take the values that were missing and only create a matrix of those terms
-   Our hypothetical data matrix will be defined as $\mathbf{Y}_{(\text{mis})}$ (sometimes denoted $\mathbf{Y}_{(0)}$)
-   Note: Again, this is not possible through any method and is only a hypothetical example to help define missing data mechanisms
:::

::: column
![](img/Ymis.png){fig-align="center" width="200"}
:::
:::

## Rubin’s Framework

::: columns
::: column
-   Models that explain whether a participant has missing values
-   How those tendencies relate to the realized data in $\mathbf{Y}_{(\text{obs})}$ or $\mathbf{Y}_{(\text{mis})}$
:::

::: column
![](img/Indicators.png){fig-align="center" width="200"}

## Example Data

```{r importData}
painData = read.table(file = "pain.dat")

```
## Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)

-   Missingness unrelated to observed or missing data

$$ P \left( \boldsymbol{M} = 1 \mid \boldsymbol{Y}_() \right) $$

### Missing at Random (MAR)

-   Missingness depends only on observed data: \[ P(M \| Y\_{\text{obs}}, Y\_{\text{mis}}) = P(M \| Y\_{\text{obs}}) \]

### Missing Not at Random (MNAR)

-   Missingness depends on missing data: \[ P(M \| Y\_{\text{obs}}, Y\_{\text{mis}}) \]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Outdated Methods

## Common Techniques

### Listwise Deletion

-   Removes all cases with missing data.
-   Reduces power; biased unless data are MCAR.

### Pairwise Deletion

-   Uses available data for each computation.
-   Inconsistent sample sizes across analyses.

### Mean Imputation

-   Fills missing values with the mean of observed values: \[ Y\_{i,\text{imputed}} = \bar{Y}\_{\text{obs}} \]
-   Reduces variance and distorts relationships.

### Regression Imputation

-   Predicts missing values using observed data: \[ Y\_{i,\text{imputed}} = \hat{\beta}\_0 + \hat{\beta}\_1 X_i \]
-   Overestimates relationships.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Planned Missing Data Designs

## Multiform Designs

-   Divide variables into overlapping subsets (forms).
-   Example: Three-form design:

\[

```{=tex}
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
\text{Form} & X & A & B & C \\
\hline
1 & O & M & O & O \\
2 & O & O & M & O \\
3 & O & O & O & M \\
\end{array}
```
\]

## Wave Missing Data Designs

-   Intentionally missing data at specific time points in longitudinal studies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Practical Example

## Chronic Pain Dataset

-   Variables:
    -   Depression scores.
    -   Perceived control over pain.

### Steps

1.  Create missing data indicators ((M_1, M_2, M_3)).
2.  Test for MCAR using Little’s test: \[ T_L = \sum\_{g=1}\^G n_g (\bar{Y}\_g - \hat{\mu})' \hat{\Sigma}\_g\^{-1} (\bar{Y}\_g - \hat{\mu}) \]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Assignments

1.  Analyze a dataset to classify missing data patterns and mechanisms.
2.  Apply diagnostics to assess the plausibility of MAR.
